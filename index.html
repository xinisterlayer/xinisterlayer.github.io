			<p>Hey there! My name is Xin :) (I pronounce it Zin) <br>
				I grew up in NorCal, moved to Philly for college at UPenn, spent three years in Boston, and recently moved to New York!<br>
				My background is in financial services and I used to consult for large banks (read: lots of Excel and Powerpoint and presentations and meetings)<br>
				I am now learning Product/UI/UX at Startup Institute to build products and meet other people and companies who are doing cool things.<br>
